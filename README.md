# Hi, I'm Nagaraj ðŸ‘‹

Full-stack developer who gets unreasonably excited about clean code and elegant solutions. Currently based in India, crafting digital experiences that don't make users want to throw their devices.

## What I do

I build things for the web. Sometimes they're useful, sometimes they're fun, hopefully they're both. My toolkit includes React, Next.js, Django, and whatever else gets the job done without overengineering it.

**Some good adventures:**
- **[JabWeMeet](https://github.com/swasthikshetty10/hackoverflow)** - Multilingual video conferencing (because the world needs more ways to awkwardly stare at each other through screens)
- **[Incridea'23](https://github.com/incridea-23/incridea-client)** - Event management system that actually works (revolutionary concept, I know)
- **[Aido](https://github.com/nagarajpandith/aido)** - A 3D multilingual chatbot that gestures while it talks. Finally, therapy that waves back.

## Currently

- Building things that matter
- Probably debugging something that worked yesterday
- Contemplating whether that semicolon is really necessary
